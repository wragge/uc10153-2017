### What this unit is about?

* This unit is about the diversity of cultural heritage collections and the techniques we use to describe, manage, use, and explore them. 
* The focus is on the intellectual, rather than physical, control. So not how we store things, but how we develop systems and standards to describe them.
* We'll also be exploring the role of descriptive systems in supporting the discovery and use of collections. What can we do with them, particularly in the digital realm?
