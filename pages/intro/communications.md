## Slack for team communications

Anyone who's used Moodle knows that it can be difficult to have conversations or keep up to date with the latest information. To overcome some of these difficulties and provide an easy-to-use communication channel, we'll be making use of Slack -- a popular messaging platform for teams.

Slack is widely used in workplaces so, unlike Moodle, it's a tool you might make use of in your future careers. It's also more fun than Moodle.

To sign up, just go to:

and use your canberra.edu.au email address to sign up. The process is painless -- just follow the instructions and you'll be set up in minutes. Once you have your account you might want to download and install one of the Slack apps, so you can have easy access on all of your devices.

For more information see Slack's [Getting Started](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-users) guide.
