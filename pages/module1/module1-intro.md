### Portfolio checklist

Here's a summary of all the tasks and activities you should have added to your portfolio as you worked through this module:

* [Some definitions](module1-GLAM.html#some-definitions): Try your own hand at some definitions. In a single sentence for each, try to capture the key features of libraries, archives and museums.

* [Introducing Trove](module1-GLAM.html#introducing-trove): Once you've discovered the source of the mystery photo, add a paragraph to your portfolio telling the story of the dog. Imagine you're writing a caption for an exhibition. Then use what you know about him to find two related resources on Trove. Add the urls to these resources to your portfolio as well.

* [Are we all collectors?](module1-GLAM.html#are-we-all-collectors): How does the ‘LRRSA’ collection differ, or not differ, from a collection held by a museum or an archive? Write a paragraph (minimum of 100 words) in your portfolio reflecting on this question.

* [Making your own Trove collection](module1-GLAM.html#making-your-own-trove-collection): Add the link to your list and a short description of its contents to your portfolio.

* [Collection bingo](module1-communities.html#collection-bingo): Copy the collection bingo categories into your portfolio and add the names and urls of the examples you find.

* [What's missing?](module1-communities.html#whats-missing): Having read Flinn’s article, what do you think is the characteristic that most distinguishes a community archive from a national or state collecting institution? Write a minimum of 200 words.

* [What's missing?](module1-communities.html#whats-missing): Use your googling powers to find an example of a collection (not in Victorian Collections!) that documents lives and experiences that might have otherwise been lost. If you're having trouble you might look at some of the projects [on this list](http://criticaldh.roopikarisam.com/social-justice-digital-humanities-projects/). In your portfolio, copy the url of the project and write a minimum of 100 words describing the collection and its significance.

* [The politics of collections](module1-communities.html#the-politics-of-collections): Read (and watch) Zinn, Sandell, and Findlay and write a minimum of 200 words reflecting on the role of the cultural heritage professional in creating and interpreting collections. What are the responsibilities of archivists, curators, and librarians, and how do you think they are changing.
