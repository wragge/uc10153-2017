### Policies and assessment

This week we'll be exploring the wonderful world of collection policies and significance assessment, or in other words, **who collects what and why?**

Last week we saw that there's tremendous diversity in the types of collections being created and in the sorts of organisations collecting them. But it's not a free-for-all -- limits need to be set for all sorts of practical reasons. A collection policy helps an organisation focus on what it's trying to achieve through its collecting activities. Even small organisations benefit from developing policies that articulate and communicate their aims.

### Why have a collection policy?

According [Museums & Galleries of NSW](http://mgnsw.org.au/sector/resources/online-resources/collection-management/collection-policy/), a collection policy 'guides the **decision making** process for shaping the collections of the museum'.

Imagine you're working in a regional museum and a local resident turns up with a crate of 'historical' artefacts they just discovered in their shed. What do you do?

A collection policy provides a **consistent framework** within which you can assess the offer and formulate a response based on your organisation's publicy-stated aims. As M&G of NSW notes 'handling such offers requires tact and diplomacy and having a written policy provides clarity for donors without offence'!

There are many other reasons why collection policies are important, for example:

* **Accessing funding** -- Potential funding bodies will want to be sure that your organisation knows what it's doing. A collection policy demonstrates your ability to plan and think strategically.
* **Setting priorities** -- Resources are always limited, a collection policy helps you decide where to focus work on describing or conserving your collection.
* **Marketing yourself** -- A collection policy articulates a clear vision for your organisation that you can use in talking the public or promoting your collections.
* **Playing nicely with others** -- Collection policies can help you avoid duplication or competition by letting other collecting organisations know what you're doing. Even better, they can form the basis for collaboration.

Can you think of any other circumstances in which it would be useful to have a collection policy?

For more see:

* [Thinking about: Collection Policies](http://mgnsw.org.au/media/uploads/files/thinking_about_collection_policies.pdf) (Museums & Galleries NSW)
* [Developing an archives policy](http://prov.vic.gov.au/community-programs/training/developing-an-archives-policy) (Public Record Office Victoria)

### What's in a collection policy?

The contents of the collection policy will vary according to the size and type of your organisation. A large organisation might, for example, have separate policies to cover things like access.

According to the [Public Record Office Victoria](http://prov.vic.gov.au/community-programs/training/developing-an-archives-policy), a collections policy should describe:

* the purpose of the archive
* why it collects
* what it collects
* what it does not collect
* who can use the material collected

Similarly, the [Small Museums Cataloguing Manual](http://www.mavic.asn.au/services/small-museums-cataloguing-manual) suggests that a collection policy should include:

* the museum's statement of purpose
* what it will collect and how
* criteria guiding object acquisition
* procedures for collection care, documentation and recordkeeping, conservation and storage, and loans
* a clause for reviewing the statement

Why is important to include a process or timetable for review in your collection policy? What might change?

Museums Australia (Victoria) provides a [handy template](http://www.mavic.asn.au/assets/MAP_Collection_Policy_Template_2.doc) for developing a collection policy. I want you to use this template to assess an existing organisations collection policies. Choose one of the policies below (or find your own) and compare it to the template -- what is and isn't included. Why do you think that is?

* [The National Archives Collecting Policy](http://www.naa.gov.au/collection/fact-sheets/fs218.aspx) (National Archives of Australia)

{: .bg-info .bg-context}
Yes, ok. The National Archives of Australia link isn't really a collection policy is it? What's different about archives, particularly government archives?

### Significance

A collection policy provides a framework for decision making, but it doesn't give all the answers. Even within this framework it's likely that hard decisions will have to be made about what to keep, or where to focus resources. Often these decisions will be informed by an assessment of the *significance* of an object or collection.

The idea of significance assessment was developed in conjunction with the [Burra Charter](http://australia.icomos.org/publications/charters/) -- a set of guidelines for the conservation and management of places of cultural significance. It has since been expanded to apply to a broader range of cultural heritage objects. The idea of significance, and the process of significance assessment is described in detail in *Significance 2.0* -- see the [complete PDF here](http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/112443/20101122-1236/significance.collectionscouncil.com.au/pdf/colour/Significance20.pdf); you can also [browse the archived website](http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/112443/20101122-1236/significance.collectionscouncil.com.au/index.html).

According to *Significance 2.0*, '"significance" refers to the values and meanings that items and collections have for people and communities'. Why is something important?

To understand the significance of an item or collection you need to research the its history and context, and assess it against a set of standard criteria. The process of significance assessment is described in Part 4 of *Significance 2.0*.

The result of the significance assessment process is a 'statement of significance', which is a reasoned and readable summary of your assessment. *Significance 2.0* notes that it is 'an argument about the meaning of an item or collection and how and why it is signicant'.

What is the difference between a catalogue entry or description and a statement of significance?

See also [Practice note: Understanding and assessing cultural significance](http://australia.icomos.org/publications/charters/).

### Assessment criteria

*Significance 2.0* recommends the use of a standard set of criteria for assessing significance. These provide you with useful prompts for spelling out how and why something is significant, and give you a consistent framework for comparing the significance of different items or collections.

There are four primary criteria and four comparative criteria. The primary criteria set out the main types of cultural value we associate with collection items:

* historic signicance
* artistic or aesthetic signicance
* scientic or research signicance
* social or spiritual signicance

The comparative criteria modify the primary criteria by indicating the degree of significance. An item's significance might be greater if it's rare, or it's provenance is well documented. The comparative criteria are:

* provenance
* rarity or representativeness
* condition or completeness
* interpretive capacity

Both sets of criteria are described in detail in Part 5 of *Significance 2.0*.

### Writing a statement of significance

Make sure you read at least Parts 4 and 5 of *Significance 2.0*. These parts walk you through the process of significance assessment.

Find an object at home is important to you, work through the significant assessment process, and prepare a short statement of significance. Remember you need to argue clearly why and how your object matters. Share your statements of significance on Slack.

### What about archives?

Signficance 2.0 notes a few differences in the ways archives consider signifcance -- such as in their understanding of provenance and the important of context.

In archives, the significance assessment process is usually called 'appraisal'. Appraisal generally starts with an understanding of who created a set of records -- the provenance. The records are then assessed to see how well they document the main functions, activities, needs, or responsibilities of the organisation that created them. In addition to this 'primary value', records can have a 'secondary value' in contributing to our broader understanding of history and culture.

The National Archives of Australia uses three broad criteria in making selection decisions:

* Government authority, action and accountability
* Identity, interaction and rights and entitlements
* Knowledge and community memory

See [What we keep](http://www.naa.gov.au/records-management/publications/what-we-keep/index.aspx) for more detail. [Preserving the historical record: Commonwealth records and social memory: if we can't remember everything, can we choose what to forget?](http://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=200105503;res=IELAPA) describes the National Archives' past attempts to broaden the process of appraisal.

### Levels of signficance

Significance 2.0 describes how signficance assessments can be made at national or even international levels. To be added to UNESCO's Memory of the World program, cultural heritage materials have to be:

* Authentic: Has identity and origin been clearly established?
* Unique and irreplaceable: Would its disappearance or deterioration constitute a harmful impoverishment of the heritage of humanity? What has been its impact and influence? 

{: .bg-info .bg-context}
How do these requirements relate to the criteria described above?

Have a browse through the collections listed on the [Australian Memory of the World website](http://www.amw.org.au/amw-register). Which do you think are the most significant and why?

### Shifting signficance

Through detailed research and the application of consistent criteria, significance assessment aims to develop a solid evidence-based framework for building and managing collections. But that doesn't mean that it's neutral, or that assessments won't change over time. As Significance 2.0 notes (p. vii):

> In assessing signicance, power is wielded in constructing societal memory and identity. Collection custodians therefore have a responsibility to consult affected communities and to be hospitable to alternative views in recognition of the fact that signicance decisions inevitably privilege some memories and marginalise or exclude others.

As we noted last week, the decisions we make in creating collections can marginalise communities or silence voices. Significance assessment has to remain sensitive to its biases. 

### METADATA!

### Standards

As you might have noticed in cataloguing your pop-up museum, one of the challenges is maintaining an appropriate level of consistency across descriptions. The worksheet provides a set of basic headings, but these might be interpreted differently, and there may be great variations in the sorts of language used, or how values like places or dates are formatted.

The impact of these variations becomes greater once you try to compare or aggregate collections -- how do you know you're really talking about the same sorts of things?

This is where standards can be useful. Standards define shared practices and meanings. 

We're lucky in the cultural heritage sector because we have LOTS AND LOTS of standards! (Ok, so maybe that's not a good thing?)

There's a lot of truth to the XKCD cartoon (which must be shown as part of any discussion about standards).

[![XKCD Standards]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/standards.png){: .img-example}](https://xkcd.com/927/)

I suggested in this week's reading that you might like to have a look at [Seeing Standards](http://jennriley.com/metadatamap/). It's quite scary -- 105 different standards are being used in the cultural heritage sector.

But fear not! You'll probably only ever encounter a small number of these, and in many cases you'll be using them without even knowing it.

Standards support the description of collections in a variety of ways. 

* **Forming frameworks** -- Standards can define the basic practices which constitute a field of activity. For example the [National Standards for Australian Museums and Galleries](http://www.mavic.asn.au/assets/NSFAMG_v1_4_2014.pdf) set out the responsibilities, expectations and activities that make a museum a museum. There are [similar sorts of standards](http://www.naa.gov.au/records-management/strategic-information/standards/international-standards/index.aspx) for archives. These sorts of standards can be used to review current practice or frame organisational policies.
* **Defining descriptions** -- Standards can define what information that should be captured about collections and how it should be structured. For example the [General International Standard Archival Description (ISAD(G))](http://www.icacds.org.uk/eng/ISAD\(G\).pdf) sets out the basic principles guiding the arrangement and description of archives.
* **Enabling exchange** -- Standards can describe how collection information can be packaged and shared to support aggregation or reuse. For example [Dublin Core](http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/) sets out a basic set of terms that are widely used to share collection information.

Another form of standard are authority lists or controlled vocabularies. These may be simple, flat lists of terms, or complex hierarchies. The widely-used [Subject Headings](http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects.html) from the Library of Congress are an example of this sort of standard. For a visualisation of the complexity of the the subject headings system see the [LoC Subject Headings Galaxy](http://cads.stanford.edu/lcshgalaxy/).

As I mentioned, most of the time you'll be using standards without even knowing it. On the Small Museums Cataloguing Manual website you might have noticed that it states the manual 'accords with Benchmark A2.4.2 of the National Standards for Australan Museums and Galleries'. The standard is being used to give context and authority to the manual.

Sometimes standards are used in the design of tools. The archival management system [AtoM](https://www.accesstomemory.org/en/) (or AccessToMemory) is designed to meet the requirements of the ISAD(G) standard. As we'll see in a couple of weeks, the core fields in [Omeka](http://omeka.org) are based on the Dublin Core standard.

Here are a few standards that you might meet:

* [Dublin Core](http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/) -- for general collection discovery
* [METS](http://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/) (Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard) -- for capturing metadata within a digital library, often combined with ALTO to represent information about digitised objects.
* [ALTO](https://www.loc.gov/standards/alto/) -- for describing the structure or layout of text objects, such as the position of articles on a newspaper page.
* [TEI](http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml) (Text Encoding Initiative) -- for representing the structure and content of digital texts.
* [CIDOC-CRM](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/) -- a framework for representing cultural heritage information
* [EAD](http://www.loc.gov/ead/) (Encoded Archival Description) -- for preparing archival finding aids
* [EAC-CPF](http://eac.staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/) (Encoded Archival Context: Corporate bodies, Persons, Families) -- for describing people and organisations associated with archival collections
* [OAI-PMH](https://www.openarchives.org/pmh/) (Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting) -- for sharing cultural heritage collections in a harvestable, machine-readable form

### Standards are not standard

But standards and authorities aren't neutral, they reflect a particular world view. Some examples of this were discussed in the readings for this week.

* [A brief history of homophobia in Dewey Decimal classification](https://overland.org.au/2015/07/a-brief-history-of-homophobia-in-dewey-decimal-classification/)
* [Controversy over the use of terms 'alien' and 'illegal immigrant' in library subject headings](https://mediamatters.org/blog/2016/06/20/republicans-slammed-trying-force-library-congress-use-anti-immigrant-language/211063)

In both cases we can see that the systems themselves have evolved over time in response to community attitudes. It's important to recognise that standards can, and probably should, change.

Standards creating organisations can also seek to involve and represent a range of perspectives. For example, the National Library of New Zealand is developing a set of [Maori Subject Headings](https://natlib.govt.nz/nga-upoko-tukutuku) that reflect a Maori world view.
