### Portfolio checklist

Here's a summary of all the tasks and activities you should have added to your portfolio as you worked through this module:

* [The basics](module3-description.html#the-basics): Below is a table listing most of the headings on the Small Museums Cataloguing Manual worksheet. By reading the [manual](http://mavic.asn.au/assets/Small_Museums_Cataloguing_Manual_4th.pdf), and the [Dublin Core guidelines](http://www.dublincore.org/documents/usageguide/elements/), I want you to create a 'mapping' that indicates how the Manual's fields can be represented in Dublin Core. Include notes where necessary to indicate what sort of guidelines or limits (such as controlled vocabularies) might need to be applied. Some mappings will be obvious, but some might require a bit of creative re-purposing. If you think there's no way of representing a field in Dublin Core, leave the column blank and explain your decision in a note. Copy the completed table into your portfolio.

* [Arrangement and description in archives](module3-description.html#arrangement-and-description-in-archives): The [Documenting the collection](https://www.prov.vic.gov.au/community/managing-your-collection/documenting-collection) page talks about the importance of 'original order' in archival description. In a few sentences, describe what you understand 'original order' to mean, and why you think it is important. Add this to your portfolio.

* [Documenting limits](module3-description.html#documenting-limits): In your portfolio write a minimum of 200 words describing a situation where it might be necessary to control access to a collection. What types of metadata might help you document, understand, and manage these limits.
