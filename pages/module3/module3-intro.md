In this module you will...

By the end you should:

* And this...

### Description and digitisation

Last week we looked at the policy frameworks and systems of value within which we develop collections. This week we're getting into the nitty-gritty of description. Over the coming weeks we'll see how the management and documentation of collections are supported by a variety of digital tools -- including Omeka, which you'll be using for your collection assignment.

### Why catalogue?

The Small Museums Cataloguing Manual describes two main reasons why it is important to catalogue a collection.

* Enriching cultural value
* Enhancing administration

By describing a collection you are capturing essential information about its meaning, value and context. This can provide the basis for further research, or support the development of exhibitions. In the case of archives, description also helps underpin the evidential value of the collection, embedding it within a set of organisational functions and relationships.

Descriptions enable discovery. As more and more collections become available online there are greater opportunities for collection items to be found and used. Connections can also be made across collections, further enriching their context.

Collections are also assets. A catalogue or descriptive system allows that asset to be managed efficiently by supporting decisions about where resources should be applied, or how priorities should be set.

Description is a form of intellectual control that allows us to grasp the meaning and signficance of collections. But it's also a way of unleashing the cultural power of collections, freeing them to support new forms of use and interpretation.

### Systems and workflows

Last week we had a go at preparing some object descriptions based on the Small Museums Cataloguing Manual. But of course in most modern workplaces it's unlikely you'll be filling out paper worksheets. The work of collection description and management is generally done through a variety of digital systems. Today we're going to have a look at the sorts of systems you might meet, and explore their differences and similarities.

### The digital environment

Once we move into the digital environment our collection descriptions become data -- we can not only read them, we can search and manipulate them in ways that that are not possible within the analogue environment. Digital collection management improves efficiency, encourages standardisation, extends discovery, and enables reuse. We can do much more with the same set of descriptions.

But there are also new challenges! Often we have to deal with different varieties of data spread across multiple systems.

For example, even if your descriptions are captured in digital form, that doesn't mean you can automatically make them available to the public. Management systems are often completely separate from the systems used to deliver collections online. Digital images of collection objects can also be stored outside of collection management systems in specialised repositories (such as Digital Asset Management Systems). What about the content of exhibitions, help documentation, or information about users? All of this might be connected in some way to your collection descriptions, but it can managed quite separately. Things can get messy.

To the world Trove is a website, providing access to millions of resources, but if you look at how that information is managed it's a much more complex (and messier!) picture.

![Trove system diagram]({{site.baseurl}}/images/trove_system.png){: .img-responsive .img-example}

So while we'll be focusing on collection management systems it's worth remembering that they will often exist within a complex ecosystem of datatabases, repositories, and indexes. And while we'd like to think that they're all seamlessly interconnected, it's possible that they won't even talk to each other!

{: .bg-info .bg-context}
When is a CMS not a CMS? One of the most confusing things is that many cultural heritage institutions will have two different systems known by the same acronymn -- CMS. A CMS can either be a **Collection** Management System, like the ones we're going to look at today, or it can be a **Content** Management System. Content Management Systems, like Drupal or WordPress, are used to create and manage whole web sites. Beware!

### Collection management systems

Here are a few well-known collection management systems:

* [Vernon](http://vernonsystems.com/) -- used by the National Gallery of Victoria.
* [TMS -- The Museum System](http://www.gallerysystems.com/products-and-services/tms/) -- used by the Australian National Maritime Museum.
* [EMu](http://www.kesoftware.com/) -- now part of the bigger [Axiell](http://alm.axiell.com/) group of CMS products; used by the National Museum of Australia.

These systems are designed for larger institutions and have a price tag to match -- although pricing information is hard to find as the systems are generally customised to the specific needs of institutions.

Over recent years, open source (ie free) alternatives have developed that match many, if not all, of the features of the proprietary systems. Of course, just because the code is free doesn't mean there are no costs for implementation -- once again considerable work can be involved in configuring, customising, and hosting the system. Open source options include:

* [CollectiveAccess](http://www.collectiveaccess.org/) -- used at the [WA Museum](https://www.gaiaresources.com.au/project/collection-management-wa-museum/)
* [CollectionSpace] -- mainly used by US university collections
* [ArchivesSpace](http://www.archivesspace.org/) -- used at the National Library of Australia
* [AtoM](https://www.accesstomemory.org/en/) (Access to Memory) -- used at the [ANU Archives](http://archivescollection.anu.edu.au/index.php/)
* [Mukurtu](http://mukurtu.org/) -- used by a number of Indigenous community groups
* [Omeka](http://omeka.org/) -- used by [Deakin University](http://fusion.deakin.edu.au/)

In between the large proprietary systems and the open source alternatives are a growing number of cloud-hosted services. These systems are generally less able to be customised, but they're easier to set up and use. All the administration and data entry takes place on an external web server. Most of these services operate on a 'freemium' model offering a basic free account with the option to pay for greater capacity or more features. Some examples include:

* [eHive](https://ehive.com/) -- used by [Canberra Museum and Gallery](https://ehive.com/collections/4826/canberra-museum-and-gallery)
* [Victorian Collections](https://victoriancollections.net.au/) -- free to use for Victorian community groups
* [Omeka.net](http://omeka.net/) -- a hosted version of Omeka (this is what you'll be using for your collections)
* [Mukurtu.net](https://codifi.org/what-we-do/) -- a hosted version of Mukurtu

The library sector tends to be dominated by large companies such as ProQuest and the [ExLibris](http://www.exlibrisgroup.com/) suite, but there are open source alternatives like [Koha](https://koha-community.org/).

### So how do you choose?

Deciding which system is appropriate for a particular collection or institution is dependent on a number of factors -- such as the size or nature of the collection, the technical support available, or who will be doing the data entry.

Here you'll find a [blank feature matrix](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rzv_xH2Vd6V5qbGHhcWLMW1RUwI15tl-WKogl1_zYyQ/edit?usp=sharing) listing a number of the collection management systems listed above. To fill it in you'll need to explore the websites and documentation for each system. In some cases there are also 'demo' or 'sandbox' versions of the software available that you can try out. In some cases you might not be able to find an answer, but do your best!

Once you've filled in the matrix, think about what would be the most approporiate system for:

* a community museum with limited technical capacity, where most of the data entry will be done by volunteers;
* a regional gallery with access to outsourced technical support and a small number of professional staff.

### Resources, processes, and contexts

![Collection space screenshot]({{site.baseurl}}/images/collectionspace.png){: .img-responsive .img-example}

If you open up the [CollectionSpace sandbox](http://core.collectionspace.org/collectionspace/ui/core/html/index.html) and try to create a new record it all looks pretty complicated. There's certainly a lot more fields than on the Small Museums worksheet. But let's have a think about what's actually being 'managed' in a collections management system.

If you click on the 'Create New' tab in CollectionSpace you're given the option to create records in three main categories -- 'Cataloguing Records', 'Vocabularly Terms', and 'Procedural Records'. The other systems have different names for these sorts of things, but what we're basically dealing with are:

* Resources -- the stuff of the collections (objects, documents, photographs)
* Contexts -- the frameworks within which the collections are created, used, discovered, or understood (people, places, concepts)
* Events -- the things that happen to collection items (loans, conservation, exhibitions)

Collection management systems are not just places for storing descriptions, they also embed those descriptions within a contextual framework that aids discovery and meaning. But the lives of resources continue within their new institutional homes, so collection management systems also capture what happens to them after they've been 'collected'.

Look at types of 'Procedural Records' defined by CollectionSpace

Of course the use of these different types of records will depend very much on accepted practices within an organisation. 

### Communities and collections

You may have noticed that Mukurtu and Omeka are a little different to the other systems. Rather than being commercial products, or open source systems aimed at particular types of institutions, Omeka and Mukurtu were developed to meet the needs of different community groups.

Mukurtu was developed for use by Indigenous communities and provides more fine-grained control over who has access to particular resources. Omeka was developed specifically to support the creation and display of online collections by a wide variety of projects or organisations. We'll talk more about what you can do in Omeka next week.

### Creating a record

Let's go to the [CollectionSpace sandbox](http://core.collectionspace.org/collectionspace/ui/core/html/index.html) and have a go at creating a record. We'll start by adding the details of my awesome Woomera postcard.

[![Postcard front]({{site.baseurl}}/images/postcard_front.jpg){: .img-responsive .img-example}]({{site.baseurl}}/images/postcard_front.jpg)

Here's the [back of the postcard]({{site.baseurl}}/images/postcard_back.jpg). This was sent to me by my sister, Sally Sherratt. It measures 87mm x 137mm.

* Login using the adminstrator credentials provided on the page.

* Click on the 'Create New' tab.
 
* Under 'Cataloguing' check 'Start from scratch'. Note that you can also start with a template that defines a subset of the available fields relevant to a particular type of item.

* Add an 'Identification number' -- it can be anything, but within an organisation you'd have some standard way of assigning unique identifiers to new items.

* Add a brief description, then click 'Save'.

* Now we're going to associate a 'Process Record' with this catalogue entry. Let's record some accession information. Click on the 'Acquisition' tab and then click 'Add record'. In the pop-up box click the 'Create' button.

* In the acquisition form add an identifier, and for the source, type in my name 'Tim Sherratt'. The system will look to see if it already knows about a person by that name, if it doesn't it will ask you if you want to add it to the list of 'Local Persons' -- click to add me!

{: .bg-info .bg-context}
'Tim Sherratt' or 'Sherratt, Tim'? -- once again questions of standardisation arise. What do you think it should be? How can you make sure items in your collection are described in a consistent way?

* Click 'Save' to add the acquisition record.

* Click on the 'Current record' tab to go back to the main description form. You should see there's now an associated procedure in the column to the right.

* Try adding in some other details such as the dimensions.

* Find the 'Associations' part of the form, and start typing my name in the 'Associated Person' box. It should find me in the Local Persons list. Select me!

* Click 'Save'. In the column on the right, you should now see my name under 'Terms used'.

* Click on my name to open up a form where you can add more details about me.

Feel free to play around some more with CollectionSpace or any of the other demo systems. Try adding some of the collection items you described on paper last week.

Don't be overwhelmed by the number of fields and options. In a practical setting, you'd probably set up templates with a limited number of fields, and you'd work within an agreed descriptive framework. 

What I wanted you to see was how a CMS captures not just descriptive information, but also processes and context. In this case, an acquisition record and a 'person'.

Omeka, you'll be pleased to know, is much simpler to use, as it doesn't offer the more sophisticated management options.

### Omeka

Last week we looked at the broad characteristics of collection management systems. This week we're goint to look in detail at [Omeka](http://www.omeka.org), the collection management system you'll be using to create your own collections.

If you haven't already, have a look at this introductory video:

{: .img-example }
<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/17084748" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>

### What is (and isn't) Omeka?

Think back to the feature matrix we worked on last week. How does Omeka stack up:

{: .table }
| Feature | Omeka |
|-----|-----|
| Pricing | Open source. Also available as [cloud-hosted service](http://www.omeka.net/) with a variety of pricing options, including a basic free account.|
| Support for standards | Descriptions based on [Dublin Core](http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/), with the ability to add new types and fields as required. |
| Public web interface | Yes, public web interface enabled by default. Administrators can choose which content is available to the public. Includes ability to create public exhibitions, combining collection items with narrative. |
| Collection management | No, Omeka doesn't capture collection management events such as loans or conservation. |
| Technical requirements | Fairly easy to install from scratch, and 'one click' installers are available from a number of web hosts such as [Reclaim Hosting](https://reclaimhosting.com/). The cloud-hosted option, [Omeka.net](http://www.omeka.net/), requires no technical setup. |
| Ease of use | Very easy for non-professional users to add and maintain and describe collections. |

You'll see that the key points of difference between Omeka and some of the other open source systems we examined is that it lacks comprehensive collection management features -- the ability to capture events in the ongoing care and use of items. On the other hand, Omeka offers something all the other systems lack -- the ability to easily create online exhibitions that present collection items within an interpretative context. With Omeka you can not only list collections, you can tell stories with them.

Tom Scheinfeldt has [described Omeka](https://foundhistory.org/2010/09/omeka-and-its-peers/) as filling a gap between collection management systems, content management systems, and repository systems:

> Omeka aims to fill this gap by providing a collections-focused web publishing platform that offers both rigorous adherence to standards and interoperability with the collections professional’s toolkit and the design flexibility, interpretive opportunities, and ease of use of popular web authoring tools.

I've chosen Omeka for your collections because of its ease-of-use. As you'll see, it's easy to create a nice looking online collection with good quality descriptive information.

**More information:**

* What's the difference between [Omeka.net and Omeka.org](http://info.omeka.net/about/)?

### Getting started

![Omeka.net]({{site.baseurl}}/images/omekanet.png){: .img-responsive .img-example}

We're going to be using the Omeka.net free account for your collections. Miriam Posner has written a great introduction to setting up your own site on Omeka.net, so we're going to start with that.

* Go to [Up and Running with Omeka.net](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/up-and-running-with-omeka) on the *Programming Historian* site.

**Carefully follow Miriam's instructions to:**

* Create your user account.
  
* Create a new site.

* Understand the difference between your admin site (the Omeka dashboard) and the public web interface.
  
* Explore your site's dashboard -- change the appearance of your public site, and install some plugins.

* Add a new item. (See below)

* Create a collection.

**Some things to note:**

* When you create your site you'll be asked to provide a subdomain and a title. You can change the title at any time in the site's settings. You can't change the subdomain, but you can just delete your site from [your account's dashboard](http://www.omeka.net/dashboard) and create a new one. So don't be too worried about what values you use at this stage -- you'll probably want to change them later on.

* When it comes time to add an item, use my awesome Woomera postcard again! Here's the [front](http://timsherratt.org/digital-heritage-handbook/images/postcard_front.jpg) and [back](http://timsherratt.org/digital-heritage-handbook/images/postcard_back.jpg). You'll need to save the images to your own computer (right click on the link, then choose **Save link as...**) before you can upload them to Omeka. Don't worry about the 'Item type' at this point -- we'll look at that below.

### Custom types and fields

As we've already noted, the main descriptive fields in Omeka are based on the [Dublin Core standard](http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/). The meaning of the fields is not always obvious -- 'coverage' for example -- so you might want to familiarise yourself with the 15 standard DC metadata elements. The Omeka help site provides [a handy introduction](https://omeka.org/codex/Working_with_Dublin_Core).

Using standards is great for consistency and interoperability, but it can sometimes be a bit restrictive. For example, there was no place to add a 'sender' and 'receiver' for my postcard. Similarly, there's no 'significance' field in the standard set.

Fortunately, Omeka lets you expand the core metadata set by adding custom item types and fields. 

* Click on **Item Types** in the left-hand dashboard menu to open a list of existing item types. Perhaps there's an existing item type you could use or modify?

* Click on 'Person'. Under 'Elements' you'll see the custom fields associated with this item type -- such as 'Birth Date' and 'Birth Place'.

* Go back to the list of item types.

* Let's add a 'Postcard' type. Click on the **Add an Item Type** button.

* In the 'Add Item Type' form, give our new type the name 'Postcard'.

* Go down the page to 'Elements'. Check 'New', and then click on **Add Element**.

* Give the element the name 'Sender', and add an appropriate description -- something like 'Name of the person who sent the postcard'.

* Repeat the step above to add a 'Receiver' element.

* While we're at it, lets add a 'Dimensions' element as well.

* Click on the **Add Item Type** button to save our new type.

Once you've defined an item type you can apply it to your descriptions. 

* Go to the list of 'Items' in your site and click on the Woomera postcard you described earlier.

* Click **Edit** to open up the description form.

* Click on **Item Type Metadata** at the top of the form.

* From the dropdown box select 'Postcard'.

* The 'Sender', 'Receiver', and 'Dimensions' fields will magically appear. Fill them in! (The postcard measures 87mm x 137mm, and was sent by my sister, Sally Sherratt.)

* Click **Save Changes**.

* Click **View Public Page**. Scroll down and you should see the postcard metadata.

{: .bg-info .bg-context}
There's always a bit of a struggle between standards and flexibility. Obviously you want to use the standard elements wherever possible, but adding new elements enables us to capture structured data in ways that support better discovery and reuse. If we had a collection of postcards, for example, we might want to be easily able to generate lists of 'senders' and 'receivers'. I'm expecting you to think carefully about this as you plan and create your own collections. Your proposal needs to include a section on metadata that should show that you've considered the descriptive requirements of your collection.

### Some extra customisation

One thing you'll notice when you look at the public view of the postcard is that there's a lot of empty fields. Displaying them seems a bit pointless. Let's fix that.

* Click on **Appearance** in the top menu of the dashboard.

* Click on the **Settings** tab.

* Down the bottom of the form you'll see a 'Show Empty Element' box -- uncheck it.

* You can also uncheck the **Show Element Set Headings** box to get rid of the ugly 'Postcard Item Type Metadata' heading on our postcard description.

* Click **Save Changes**.

* Go back to the public view of the postcard (refresh the page if necessary). That looks much better!

### More than text

You may have noticed the little 'Use HTML' check boxes under the fields in the item edit screen. They allow you to enter formatted text, and more!

* Go back to the Woomera postcard and open it for editing.

* Click on the **Item Type Metadata** tab.

* Go to the 'Receiver' field, and check the use HTML box.

You'll see that an assortment of formatting widgets appear. They're very similar to those provided in Moodle and elsewhere.

* Select my name and click on the 'Insert /edit link' button. 

* Enter my website url -- <http://timsherratt.org> -- click **Insert**, and then **Save Changes**.

* Try some of the other formatting tools.

Using the HTML option you can also embed resources from other websites, such as videos, sound clips, maps, or charts. Many sites such as YouTube, SoundCloud, and Google Maps provide you with the option to embed their resources in your own site. Let's see how!

It would be good to add a bit more information about the Woomera Rocket Range to the description of my postcard. Searching on YouTube, I found this movie from 1962.

{: .img-example}
<iframe width="100%" height="400px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cwUl0nNdjkA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The movie is appearing in this page because I've dropped in a little bit of code to embed it. We can add the same bit of code to Omeka.

* Go [to the movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwUl0nNdjkA) on YouTube.

* Click on the **Share** link to open the sharing box.

* Click on the **Embed** tab.

* Copy the contents of the box.

The embed code will look something like this:

``` html
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cwUl0nNdjkA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
```

You can adjust the size and other options by click on the **Show More** link.

* Now open up the postcard for editing again.

* Go to the 'Description' field on the **Dublin Core** screen.

{: .bg-info .bg-context}
If you were adding a lot of videos, you might want to add a special field for them to your item type.

* Check the 'Use HTML' box under the description field.

* To add the embed code we have to edit the HTML of the field directly. Click on the **HTML** button to open the HTML source editor.

* You might need to insert a blank line after any existing text. Then just paste in the code from YouTube.

* Click **Update** to close the source editor. Don't worry if all you see in the 'Description' field is a yellow box -- the video will be inserted later.

* Click **Save Changes**. The video should now be visible in the item description.

* Click on **View Public Page** to see it in action.

It's not just videos -- you might like to create a Google Map that locates your item and embed that in your description. Or perhaps you might record, share, and embed oral history interviews? Note also that you can also embed things like this in Omeka exhibits (see below for creating exhibits).

### An instant exhibition

![In memoriam]({{site.baseurl}}/images/inmemoriam.png){: .img-responsive .img-example}

What if you've already got your descriptions in a spreadsheet or database? Omeka provides you with a number of ways you can move data in and out of your site. One of the simplest is the 'CSV Import' plugin. We're going to use it to create an instant exhibition.

* First we need to install the plugin. Click **Plugins** in the top dashboard menu.

* Find 'CSV Import' and click the **Install** button.

* Download the file [inmemorium.csv](https://www.dropbox.com/s/md18vgv6kz9irz9/inmemoriam.csv?dl=0) and save it somewhere you can find again. This is a [spreadsheet from the State Library of WA](http://data.gov.au/dataset/in-memoriam-cards), made available on the data sharing site [data.gov.au](http://data.gov.au/). The notes describe it as a 'Collection of "In Memoriam" cards with photographs of West Australians killed during the First World War, with brief biographical notes'. I've modified the file slightly to add direct links to images, and limited it to the first 50 rows (to speed up the import).

* Once you've installed the plugin, you'll see a CSV Import link appears in the left-hand dashboard menu. Click on it.

* Go to 'Upload CSV File' and select the 'inmemoriam.csv' file you just downloaded.

* Go to 'Automap Column Names to Elements' and **uncheck** the box.

* Go to 'Select Item Type' and choose 'Still Image'.

* Go to 'Make All Items Public?' and check the box.

* Leave the other fields as they are. Click on the **Next** button.

You'll see a sample row from the CSV file that you can use to map the fields in the file to the elements in Omeka.

![CSV Import mapping]({{site.baseurl}}/images/csvimport.png){: .img-responsive .img-example}

* Go to 'Record number' and select 'Identifier' from the 'Map to Element' box.

* In the same way map 'Title' and to 'Title'.

* Map 'Published' to 'Date'.

* Map 'Description' to 'Format'.

* Map 'Subject' to 'Description'.

* Map 'Subject - Person' to 'Subject'.

* Map 'Series' to 'Source'.

* Now go to 'Image' and simply check the box that says 'Files?'. Omeka will automatically download the images and add them to the records.

* Click the **Import CSV File** button.

* The status screen will appear, telling you your import has started. It might take a little while to grab all the images. Refresh the status page to see how it's going, or click on Items to see what's been added.

* Have a look at your public site. If you're not using the 'Seasons' theme, go into **Appearance** and select it -- it displays images better than most of the others. Look again at your public site!

### Featuring items

If you look at the public home page of site you'll see there's a box for a 'Featured item'. You can choose whether or not this box appears by editing the settings of your theme. But let's keep it and select some items to populate it.

* Go to the **Items** list in your dashboard.

* Check the box next to the items you want to feature.

* Click the **Edit** button at the top of the list.

* You can now edit all the selected items at once. Go to 'Featured?' and select 'Featured'.

* Click on **Save Changes**.

* Now reload your site's public home page. One of the items you edited will be chosen at random and featured.

### Other useful plugins

It's always useful to have an 'About' page on your site that explains in more detail what the site is for and how it was created. You can easily add one with the 'Simple Pages' plugin.

* Click on **Plugins** in the top dashboard menu.

* Find 'Simple Pages' and click **Install**.

* A new **Simple Pages** button will appear in the left-hand menu. Click on it.

* The plugin has automatically created an 'About' page for you. Click on the Edit to change the content.

* Check the 'Use HTML editor?' box to add the formatting widgets to the 'Text' box.

* Edit the contents of the 'Text' box to say whatever you want.

* Click **Save Changes**.

* Click **View Public Page** to see your brand new 'About' page. Note that an 'About' link has also been added to your site's menu bar.

You can use the 'Simple Pages' plugin to [add additional pages](http://info.omeka.net/simple-pages/) and arrange them in a hierarchy.

### Navigation and discovery

It's no point creating a fantastic collection if people can't find their way around it. There are various things you can do to enhance navigation and discovery.

First think about the structure of your site and your collection. It might help users if you create a series of thematic collections, rather than just one big catch-all grouping. (Go back to Miriam's tutorial if you've forgotten how to create and use 'Collections' in Omeka.)

Have a look at this sample site -- [Artists, Patrons, and Japanese Art](http://artistandpatrons.omeka.net/). Note that it divides its 21 items between five thematic collections. The [Browse Collections](http://artistandpatrons.omeka.net/collections/browse) page gives a good overview of the site and its contents.

You can also provide opportunities for exploring connections between items by making use of tags. Tags are assigned to individual items. Once again the [Artists, Patrons, and Japanese Art](http://artistandpatrons.omeka.net/) site provides a good example of [tags in action](http://artistandpatrons.omeka.net/items/tags).

{: .bg-info .bg-context}
Note that I'll be looking at the way you use collections and tags in assessing your projects. Start thinking about this at the proposal stage -- do you need a controlled vocabulary for your tags? What types of metadata will best support discovery?

There are various other ways in which you can customise the navigation options in Omeka:

* Under **Appearance** click on **Navigation** to change the links that appear in your main menu bar.

* Under **Appearance** click on **Themes** and then **Configure Theme** to change how featured items and collections appear on your home page.

### Going further

As we've noted, Omeka lets you create your own online exhibitions using your collection items. You don't need to do this for your assessment, but if you're interested have a look at [Creating an Omeka Exhibit](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/creating-an-omeka-exhibit) by Miriam Posner and Megan R. Brett.

### Additional resources

* There's an [extensive help section](http://omeka.org/codex/Documentation) on Omeka.org, including a useful [collection of screencasts](http://omeka.org/codex/Screencasts) covering the main administrative tasks. Note that some options might not be available in the free hosted Omeka.net account.

* Omeka.net has [its own help system](http://info.omeka.net/), which covers everything you need to know to manage your account and build your site. There's even a series of potential 'Use Cases' that explore how Omeka can be used for different purposes.

### Digital collections

Throughout the unit we've talked a lot about making collections available online. In some cases we're just talking about publishing the metadata, such as in a library catalogue, or an archival finding aid. But increasingly there's an expectation that the full content of collections will be made available in digital form -- that we can access books, photos, sound and video with just a simple click. This week we're going to talk about how that happens and why. What are digital collections, and how do we create them?

### Defining digital

First we need to distinguish between two broad types of digital objects -- those that are 'digitised', and those that are 'born digital'. Something is digitised when we create a digital representation of an analogue object -- when we scan a document, or photograph a book. 

A born digital resource -- such as a piece of software, or a word processing document -- came into existence within a computing system. We may later print out that word processing document to create an a physical copy, but the original object was, and remains, on our computer.

Processes for the creation, collection, preservation and management of these two types of digital resources can be quite different.

### The scale of digitisation

Remember in week 2 when we had a look at the GLAM Innovation Study? They estimated that about 25% of the estimated 100 million objects in Australian museums and galleries had been digitised in some form. The [National Archives of Australia estimates](http://www.naa.gov.au/collection/fact-sheets/fs249.aspx) that it has created more than 27 million digital images of archival resources. As of July this year the [National Library reported](https://www.nla.gov.au/digitisation) that it had digitised a total of 244,909 collection items (made up of 1,314,025 images). And of course that doesn't include the 200 million digitised newspaper articles in Trove. 

![NLA digitisation data]({{site.baseurl}}/images/nla-digitisation-data.png){: .img-example .img-responsive}

Under it's [Digital Excellence program](http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/research-collections-building-our-collections/digitising-librarys-collections), the State Library of NSW is planning to create over 20 million collection images or pages.

Digitisation is now part of the core business of major collecting organisations. But does that mean we should just push ahead and digitise everything?

Yeah... Nah.

The ease with which we can access digital collections disguises the work involved in creating and managing them. Digitisation is an expensive business and the costs don't stop once an image is made. If you ever get a chance to peek in the National Library's server room you'll see that Trove's online newspapers have an huge physical footprint.

So decisions have to be made about what gets digitised and why. The National Archives of Australia lets users make some of these decisions. Its 'digitisation on demand' service means that if you request (and pay for) a copy of a file, that file is digitised and made publicly accessible through RecordSearch. This is combined with a 'proactive digitisation' service to digitise records that are highly-used or of known research value -- such as the WWI service records. The digitisation of newspapers for Trove is guided by a [selection policy](https://www.nla.gov.au/content/australian-newspaper-digitisation-program-selection-policy) with input from the national, state, and teritory libraries. The public can make suggestions as well.

If you haven't seen it before, you might like to ponder my graph of the number of digitised newspaper articles in Trove per year.

![Trove articles by year]({{site.baseurl}}/images/303.png){: .img-responsive .img-example}

Following on from last week's discussion, you can clearly see the copyright cliff of death in 1955. But why do you think there's that peak in the number of articles in 1914? Did something important happen in 1914? Were there more newspapers?

The answer is that's where the digitisation dollars have been spent. In the lead up to the Centenary of WWI it was decided to focus resources on newspapers of the WWI period. Decisions have been made based on limited resources.

But even if money wasn't a problem, would we want to digitise everything? Have a read of ['digitization: just because you can, doesn’t mean you should'](http://tararobertson.ca/2016/oob/) by Tara Robertson. It raises a number of important ethical questions about the need to consult with affected communities. How does the digital environment challenge our ideas of consent and privacy? Should, for example, digitised collections like Trove's newspapers remove articles about a person's criminal convictions, or suicide attempts? On the one hand they're already on the public record, but on the other digitisation makes them as easy to find as a simple Google search.

In Australia, cultural institutions pay careful attention to issues around the digitisation of Indigenous cultural materials. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Library, Information and Resource Network provides a [set of protocols](http://atsilirn.aiatsis.gov.au/protocols.php) to guide projects and practices.

### Digitisation planning

Digitisation projects require careful planning to ensure that they're responsible, cost-effective, and sustainable. There are plenty of guides available online for organisations undertaking such projects. For example:

* [Digitising your collections sustainably](https://www.jisc.ac.uk/guides/digitising-your-collections-sustainably) by Jisc provides links to a range of checklists, toolkits and case studies.

* [Digitising your collection](https://archivesoutside.records.nsw.gov.au/digitising-your-collection-part-1-project-planning/) is a series of blog posts by State Records NSW which provides a clear summary of both the planning and technical issues you need to consider.

* [Just digitise it](http://prov.vic.gov.au/community-programs/training/just-digitise-it) is a training package developed the PROV for community groups.

The PROV guides sets out some basic questions that should be asked before undertaking any digitisation project:

* What will you digitise?
* How much will you digitise?
* How long will it take?
* How much will it cost?
* Who will do the work?
* How will you look after your new digitised collection?

The Jisc guide also emphasises the need to plan for sustainability -- digitised collections require ongoing management, just like physical ones. Sustainability is also linked to use and impact -- how can you demonstrate that digitisation provides good value? Resources such as the [Balanced Value Impact Model](http://www.kdcs.kcl.ac.uk/innovation/impact.html) provide a framework for measuring the value of digital collections. The Model defines impact as:

> The measurable outcomes arising from the existence of a digital resource that demonstrate a change in the life or life opportunities of the community for which the resource is intended.

Obviously then you also need to be thinking about why you're digitising stuff, and who is going to use your digital collections. Digitisation might be undertaken for a number of purposes, including:

* to help preserve collections by providing an alternative means of access;
* to enable specific research projects;
* to support internal management or business uses;
* to provide large-scale public access.

Each of these purposes might have its own set of justifications and measures of success.

### Digitisation processes

Having said all that, digitisation doesn't need to be complicated. Developments in technology make it pretty easy for any organisation to create good quality digital collections. This video from PROV is aimed at community organisations and does a good job of demystifying the process.

Want to make your own book scanner with an old cardboard box and some duct tape? Here's an [online guide](http://www.instructables.com/id/Bargain-Price-Book-Scanner-From-A-Cardboard-Box/) that will help you do just that.

Of course larger organisations will have access to more sophisticated technologies. Modern book scanners can even turn pages automatically without damaging the source materials. Here's an example of the 'high-end' technology.

### But what actually is digitisation?

So far we've really talked about digitisation in terms of capturing images of physical objects. This is typically done using digital cameras or scanners. Those digital images might undergo further processing such as cropping or color correction.

But digitisation is not just about pictures. One of the most important technologies in opening up digital access to print collections is Optical Character Recognition or OCR. OCR finds text inside images and makes it available in a form that can be easily searched or manipulated. Trove's 200 million newspaper articles are searchable because the text content has been extracted and saved using OCR. And they don't have to be in English -- Trove includes newspapers in a variety of languages, [including Chinese](https://www.nla.gov.au/blogs/trove/2015/02/19/early-chinese-newspapers)!

But OCR has its limitations. A quick look on Trove will find plenty of examples where the text produced by OCR is pretty much unreadable. The accuracy of OCR is very much dependent on the quality of the source materials. Trove tries to get around this through people power -- Trove users can easily correct dodgy OCR. It's very simple:

* Go to [Trove's digitised newspapers](http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/) and find an article with dodgy OCR.

* Hover over the line in the OCR text that you want to correct -- you'll see a little pencil icon appear.

* Click on the pencil icon. You can correct text without a use account, just answer the question to prove you're not a robot.

* The line you've selected will then be highlighted. Just click in the box to start editing.

* Click on another line to continue correcting.

* Once you've finished just click **Save & Exit**.

Trove text correction is an example of 'crowdsourcing' -- which is a broad and somewhat inaccurate term to describe ways in which organisations can seek the assistance of their users. There are now lots of crowdsourcing projects in the cultural heritage domain -- we'll be looking at some more next week.

OCR enables us to digitise printed text, but what about handwritten materials? They're a lot harder of course, but there's some exciting work going on at the moment around the [Transkribus project](https://transkribus.eu/Transkribus/). It's still in its early days, but it's demonstrating how, with enough computing power, you can develop systems for that recognise handwritten text. There's a neat demo you can try out:

* [Go here](http://transcriptorium.eu/demots/htr/index.php/ui/pages/01-bentham-short/1) to see a selection of manuscript pages from the collection of the English philosopher Jeremy Bentham.

* Click on any page and wait while the handwriting recognition system loads.

* You'll notice that lines of text have already been highlighted. Click on one and the system will attempt to extract the text.

It's an impressive demonstration, but you should note that it's only possible because the system has already been trained with manually transcribed examples of Bentham's handwriting -- you can't just feed any old handwritten text to it and expect good results.

As well as images and text recognition, there are a growing range of tools and techniques for creating digital representation of objects. A number of cultural institutions are experimenting with 3D imaging of their collections -- this means they're not just capturing how an object looks, they're recording its spatial dimensions -- it's shape and size -- as a digital model which can viewed from a variety of perspectives. 

Have a browse of the Smithsonian's [collection of 3d models](https://3d.si.edu/browser). Click on a thumbnail to open the object in a 3d viewer. Try rotating and zooming!

You may have seen some stories in the news recently which described some of the possibilities of more advanced digital imaging techniques -- techniques that look below the surface of the object to see what we cannot. One group of scientists used 3d xray scanning to [virtually unwrap](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/sep/21/jubilation-as-scientists-use-virtual-unwrapping-to-read-burnt-ancient-scroll) an ancient scroll that had been severely damaged.

<iframe width="100%" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VfNl7z-vFl4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

In Australia, the [National Gallery of Victoria worked with scientists](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-08-04/uncovering-the-hidden-woman-behind-an-edgar-degas-portrait/7686430) to apply a technique known as X-ray fluorescence to a 19th century portrait by French impressionist Edgar Degas. As a result they discovered a second portrait underneath the main one -- all without any damage to the original. One of the scientists noted:

> The technique is pretty well established but now that commercial scanners are coming out to do this kind of work I think it's really going to take off and we are going to see a lot more of it.

These more advanced analytical techniques are also forms of digitisation.

### Standards -- of course!

Yes, we can't discuss digitisation without at least some reference to our favourite topics -- standards and metadata.

According to the SRNSW guide, the [golden rule of digitisation](https://archivesoutside.records.nsw.gov.au/digitising-your-collection-part-2-the-golden-rule-of-digitisation/) is ‘capture once, use many times’. This means you should digitise your collections in a way which will support a range of uses -- some you may not even have though of yet!

The easiest way to do that is to create a high-resolution master file which is carefully managed and preserved over time. The master file is then used to create 'derivatives' -- lower resolution copies for particular purposes, such as online display. The SRNSW guide includes a useful section on understanding [technical specifications](https://archivesoutside.records.nsw.gov.au/digitising-your-collection-part-3-technical-specifications/).

But there's no point creating wonderful images if you don't also capture and preserve information about where they've come from and how they were created. Appropriate metadata is crucial to the management and long-term value of digital collections.

### Born digital

Every now and then you'll see a story pop up in the media about the 'digital deluge' or the looming dangers of a 'digital black hole'. The argument is that we're not doing enough to preserve contemporary online activity for future study -- we're in danger of losing many 'born digital' resources.

While we could always be doing more, these stories tend to overlook the fact that many people in the cultural heritage sector are actively grappling with these problems -- new tools, technologies, and even new professions are emerging in order to preserve and make accessible our digital heritage.

For example, digital forensics is a new field that works with digital storage media to analyse and extract their contents. What would you do if a famous writer donated her computer and a set of floppy disks to your collection? Platforms like [BitCurator](https://www.bitcuratorconsortium.org/) provide a set of tools that enable cultural heritage professionals to view the contents of digital media **without changing them**. This is important as most operations on a computer leave some trace on the files themselves.

Digital archivists are designing systems that capture metadata at the point of creation to ensure that born digital records are embedded within systems of preservation and control. 

But how do you preserve 'born digital' records in a way that ensures they can still be accessed and used -- after all technology is changing all the time!

There are a number of diferent approaches to the problem of access:

* you can try and preserve all of the hardware and software necessary to access digital objects;
* you can migrate the content of the digital objects into open and sustainable formats;
* you can create a software environment that emulates the original technology.

Each approach has its own strengths and weaknesses, and often institutions will use a combination of these techniques.

For example, one of the BitCurator case studies concerns [the archives of the novelist Salman Rushdie](https://www.bitcuratorconsortium.org/case-study/salman-rushdie-archive). His collection includes a number of the computers used to write his novels. The Rose Library at Emory University now provides access to this born digital collection in two ways through [a dedicated workstation](http://rose.library.emory.edu/using/reading-room/digital-archives-access.html). Researchers can browse a list of files that have been extracted and migrated from their original formats, but they can also interact with an emulation of Rushdie's Macintosh Performa 5400 -- using this emulation that can explore the author's digital workspace, opening files using original software.

The possibilities of emulation have expanded considerably in recent years. It is now possible to run a functioning operating system within a web browser. Want to try? The Internet Archive includes a growing collection of software and games that you can explore.

* Explore one of the [early versions of Windows](https://archive.org/details/msdos_win3_1).

* Try your hand at a [classic MS-DOS game](https://archive.org/details/softwarelibrary_msdos_games).

There are also a number of projects aimed at preserving online content, including websites and social media. 

* The Internet Archives also preserves a large part of the web, which you can explore using the [WayBack machine](http://archive.org/web/).

* The National Library of Australia maintains a selective web archive called [Pandora](http://pandora.nla.gov.au/) -- many significant Australian sites are preserved there (including my blog!).

* The National Library also harvests Australian government websites. Using the [Australian Government Web Archive](http://webarchive.nla.gov.au/gov/) you can hunt down all those controversial media releases that mysteriously disappear from politicians' web sites.

* The State Library of NSW is working with CSIRO to harvest social media content relating to specific events.
